## Loadtime & rendering optimisation 

The loadtime is extremely important for a good conversion. But next to that, the customer experience after loading is also very important.

Is the page scrolling smooth? No stuttering? Are the animations smooth, and how is that for the old android phones?

A website can be made so beautifully and smart. But if things don't work smooth, the experience for the customer ain't great.

In the past i've optimized different big website's.
