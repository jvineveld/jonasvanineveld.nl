## Plain HTML-templates

Minimal code with great result. When creating HTML-templates i usually only create a static document, existing of HTML, CSS (sass or less) and JavaScript.

These templates serve as a base for developers to connect theire code to. So expect of every page type a html document, with assats folder.

In consulation with the developers, there can be a choise made for specifik structures / formats of pages that meet the requirements. Offcourse as much as possible will be split up into reusable applications.
