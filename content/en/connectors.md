## Connecting systems

Many times, within companies, many different platformes are used. If these platforms don't connect well, this could lead to extra labour like inserting information twice, or information that get's lost by human error.

I've got experience with connecting MailChimp, SugarCRM, ClockWise, Slack, Facebook and the Google Cloud environment.

As long as there is a REST, Oauth, or any other API available, there can be connected :-)
