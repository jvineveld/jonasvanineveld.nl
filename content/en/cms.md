## WordPress & Magento 1/2

For the management of a website usually a CMS is used.

The past 7 years i've been (front-end) developing lots of templates for wordpress and Magento 1 & 2.

Also, the development of plugins, extensions and shortcodes for these platforms has not been a problem.

Do you have a WordPress or Magento website and a cool idea? Please contact me, i like challenges!
